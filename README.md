 ## *Description*
 ### This is my submission for the week #14 Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge: Tech Blog. Our challenge was to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress iste, where developers can pbulish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well.  The site was to be built completely from scratch and deployed to Heroku.  It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session npm package for authentication.

 ### The app allows all visitors to the site to read blog posts and their respective comments.  Authorized users who are logged into the app are allowed to leave comments on any blog post as well as edit their own posts.
